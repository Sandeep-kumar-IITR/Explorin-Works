Hello ,
This is sandeep,
This project is assign to me by explorin .
In this project i fetch previous data of company and train system to predict the next day nature of stock .

I know it is not possible but after training i find its accuracy is about 59%

Now i want to discuss the scemas:

1 -> for a company let 'TCS' 
2 -> fetch stock history of 1000 day from day before yesterday
3 -> add a column called change , it value is 0 if stock is not in loss on that day
4 -> now make change column as the dependent variable. in simple word my trained system find it. (say y)
5 -> after droping some unuseful column all the remanings are depending variable (say x)

6 ->  now delete 1st row of y and last row of x 
7 -> so by using previous our goal to predict change of next day

8 -> now split data in train and test as 70% is training data set

9 -> now this is time to apply logistic regression and visualization

10 -> at the end i take data of yesterday and predict the stock value of tommorow 
11 -> and finally i export a csv file its name is of next day and it cointain change of next day and accuracy
